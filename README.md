# Shaker - Monitor your building!

Shaker creates a 3D animation of buildings which are exposed to seismic waves. The animation demonstrates translational and rotational deformations for each sensored floor by using an appropriate color palette. Also, ground motion and roof floor are supported with a tracer to observe the movement simulatenously and track the motion from top view, respectively.
